00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,600
Hi, welcome to another episode of ColdFusion. Take a look at this picture. It features prominent

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,919
tech individuals like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai,

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,800
and Tesla's Elon Musk. As of recording this video, the combined net worth of these four

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,480
people is over $700 billion. In fact, Mark, Jeff, and Elon are centi-billionaires.

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
Of course, the recent stock market dip may have wiped off some of their wealth,

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
but these billionaires can still sleep easy enough at night. People with dozen-digit fortunes

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,240
didn't exist eight years ago, but now according to the Forbes 2025 billionaire list, a record

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,719
15 people are on that list, and that's up from just six in 2023. When Forbes first made this

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,519
list in 1987, they had to scrape to find individuals worth more than $28 billion,

10
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:57,200
adjusted for inflation, and all they could find were just two Japanese tycoons. And now

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,240
today, that $28 billion amount isn't even enough to land you in the top 50 of that list.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,159
The trend is as clear as day. There's no stopping these billionaires. In 2024 alone,

13
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,000
billionaire wealth surged by $2 trillion. That's at a rate three times faster than

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,520
the entire global economy. And for the first time in history, the richest Americans now pay

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,520
less tax than the working class. Something is clearly wrong. But what? It's not a question

16
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,840
of why there's such inequality, but more a question of how this is all happening.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,359
Why are families struggling to buy cartons of eggs, while billionaires seem to keep adding

18
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,679
to their wealth with absolute ease? What happens to the world economy if this trend

19
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:44,560
keeps on going? Does the middle class cease to exist? And what can we do to fix all of this

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,359
and not repeat the same mistakes? Let's take a look.

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,200
The world's richest people are just getting richer and even faster than expected.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
Oxfam's annual inequality report says five people are now on track to reach

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,720
trillionaire status within the next decade. Elon Musk is first in line,

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,160
followed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,320
LVMH's Bernard Arnaud. Whenever numbers like millions, billions and trillions are discussed,

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,000
it's often difficult to put the vast difference between them into context.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,200
So let's start there. If you, yes you watching, made $1 every second,

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
you'd be a millionaire in 12 days. That's under two weeks.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,320
But how long would it take to reach a billion dollars? Six months? A year? Well,

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,480
at a rate of $1 per second, every day, non-stop, you'd need over 31 years.

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
And that's just for 1 billion. As we know, the world's richest have not just 1 billion,

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,160
but tens, even hundreds of billions. And their wealth just keeps growing.

33
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:06,639
For example, in 2024, their combined wealth skyrocketed from 13 trillion to 15 trillion

34
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,120
in just 12 months. And the richest 10 men saw their fortunes grow by an average of 100 million

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,519
per day. That's more than what entire villages or towns in some parts of the

36
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,680
world will earn in a lifetime, every single day. And these guys, the billionaires,

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,199
have been absolute vacuum cleaners of wealth over the past few decades.

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,560
The top 1% alone has captured 38% of all new wealth created since 1995.

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,640
And this is at the same time where the poorest half of the world's population,

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,200
which is around 3.8 billion people, owns just 2% of global wealth.

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,200
Think about that for a second. No matter how you look at it, these stats are staggering.

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,560
The ultra-rich are clearly pulling further ahead, while half the world is effectively

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,800
locked out of wealth. And it goes further. It's not just numbers on paper.

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,479
This kind of money can warp economies, influence politics,

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,520
and shape the world in ways that we can barely comprehend.

46
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,759
You don't see it much on TV. You don't hear it talked about here at all.

47
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,439
But the American people do not believe that it is appropriate that three people, one, two,

48
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:25,439
three, Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos, and Mr. Zuckerberg, three Americans own more wealth than the bottom

49
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:33,279
half of American society, 170 million people. And that's not a useless fact either. Massive

50
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,839
wealth inequality usually comes before internal conflict. Or more accurately,

51
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:44,879
it's a symptom of a deeper problem. When the government has problems funding itself,

52
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,800
when there are bad economic conditions and living standards for most people are declining,

53
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:59,439
and there are large wealth values and political gaps, internal conflict between the rich and

54
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,680
the poor as well as different ethnic, religious, and racial groups greatly increases.

55
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,759
This leads to political extremism that shows up as populism of the left or the right.

56
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,959
Those of the left seek to redistribute the wealth, while those of the right seek to

57
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,719
maintain the wealth in the hands of the rich. Ray Dalio, a billionaire investor and economic

58
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:28,159
historian puts it this way. Quote, I've studied the last 500 years of history and cycles,

59
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,879
and these things repeat over and over again. Large wealth gaps with large value gaps at

60
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,959
the same time, as there's a lot of debt and there's an economic downturn produces

61
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,079
conflict and vulnerability. One of the biggest impacts the rising wealth gap has had is the

62
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,159
shrinking middle class. The middle class is one of the hallmarks of a healthy economy,

63
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,000
so when they shrink and start to falter, it's a symptom of a wider problem.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,039
It's been a slow process, but we all know deep down that something is going wrong.

65
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,079
If you think back to the TV shows of the 80s and the 90s, it wasn't uncommon to find

66
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,879
characters that live comfortably on just a single wage. Life was portrayed as financially

67
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,680
easy, and that's because relatively, it really was. But then things started to go wrong.

68
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,199
When you really think about how the economy has been, since I left high school in the late 2000s,

69
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
the middle class just couldn't catch a break. In 2008, there was the housing crisis,

70
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
which turned into an international global financial crisis. Europe got a second wind

71
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,800
of that disaster around 2011. In most of the western world, the average Joe was hit by an

72
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,920
economic bomb. Small businesses closed, jobs were lost, and households were struggling.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,960
Over the next decade, growth was permanently slower than before because the real economy had died,

74
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,879
and I've covered that in detail in a previous video. But other than that,

75
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,960
people were still getting by, but then came COVID. The government response shuttered entire

76
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,600
economies, leaving everyday people straining themselves just to get by. And there's a

77
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,480
famous saying, question, what words do you never want to hear? Answer, I'm from the

78
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,600
government and I'm here to help. And this joke played out in real time when governments

79
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,360
turned on the money printers to counteract their shutdown policies. They thought they

80
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,879
were helping, but the result was yet another disaster. Now, today, we're left with rising

81
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,400
inflation, stagnant wages, and soaring living costs. And the pressure is only getting worse.

82
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,000
The middle, 40% of the global population, owns just 22% of global wealth. But at the

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,199
top end of town, it's exactly the opposite. Making money seems easier than ever before.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
As it turns out, all that government printing helped the stock market,

85
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
which helped the billionaires. But we'll get to that in a bit.

86
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,879
As the saying goes, wealth begets more wealth. So this acceleration will continue. But before

87
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,600
we get into the weeds, we need to back up a little bit. How are these guys getting so rich?

88
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
How does one even become a billionaire?

89
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,080
Is it ethical to be a billionaire? Well, that depends on your political leanings.

90
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,439
But some individuals do indeed have a rag to riches story. But the pleasantries start and

91
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,320
end there. A growing number of billionaires tend to come through one of three routes,

92
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,439
monopolies, inheritance, and corruption. According to Forbes, the most common way

93
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,399
to become a billionaire is through finance. In fact, nearly one in six billionaires,

94
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,759
or just over 15%, made their money in finance and investments. The second most common way is

95
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,680
technology at 12%. And the third, manufacturing, also at 12%. But it's not just by hard work

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,679
and innovation. Billionaires don't play by the same rules as the rest of us.

97
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,200
And in this section, we'll cover the three ways that this is the case.

98
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,720
Number one, inheritance. In 2023, more new billionaires inherited their wealth than built

99
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,560
it. Every single billionaire under 30 was born rich. The problem is, in a lot of cases,

100
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
depending on where you are, there's no tax on this kind of wealth transfer.

101
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,320
While the average person works decades to build financial security,

102
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,879
billionaire families pass down fortunes, tax-free, and they keep their wealth locked

103
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,640
up in an exclusive family club. Number two, corruption and loopholes. Many argue that the

104
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,840
financial system is designed to protect the wealthy. Just look at the 2008 financial crisis.

105
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,799
Banks made reckless bets, crashed the economy, and then got bailed out with billions in taxpayer

106
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,679
dollars. It's capitalized the profits and socialized the losses. Meanwhile, millions of

107
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,759
people lost their homes, jobs, and savings. And it's not just banks. The very top percent

108
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,480
of earners avoid taxes like a plague. They stash money in offshore accounts or borrow

109
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,960
against their assets instead of selling them. And this means that they don't have taxable income.

110
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,759
If I told you that in the U.S., for example, the richest 25 people in the country paid an

111
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,920
effective tax rate of 3.4%, you'd cry foul. Why should the average person be taxed at

112
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,519
six times more when they earn a tiny, infinitesimal fraction of what the billionaires earn?

113
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,960
Well, although unfair, it's perfectly legal and it's a bit of a rabbit hole.

114
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,360
But hear me out. This is called the buy-borrow-die technique.

115
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,519
Edward McCaffrey, the scholar who coined the term buy-borrow-die, says that this technique

116
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,879
is being abused so much that it, quote, has basically killed the entire concept of an

117
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,680
income tax for the wealthiest individuals, end quote. But he goes on to add that it's, quote,

118
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,360
the most important tax avoidance strategy today, end quote. So here's how it goes.

119
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,279
Instead of working a nine-to-five wage and then getting taxed like a pleb,

120
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,519
the best way to earn wealth is through accumulating appreciating paper assets like

121
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,399
stocks. The wealth isn't taxed until these stocks are sold. Yes, a tariff surprise or

122
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,879
another stock market shock may make the wealthy sweat a little bit. But overall,

123
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,800
in the big picture over the past few decades, you'd be doing well.

124
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,800
And the next step, borrow. Since there are no taxes for loans, the genius part of this

125
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,960
is that the wealthy simply just borrow against their existing assets to buy more things.

126
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,200
Take Larry Ellison of Oracle, for example. He built a 270 million dollar yacht, an 80 million

127
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,840
dollar mansion, and even bought an island worth 30 million, all from borrowing against

128
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,400
30 billion of Oracle's stock as collateral. But I know what you're thinking. You can't

129
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,640
just keep doing this. These loans have to be paid off at some time. And when they do,

130
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,080
these guys are going to have to sell their assets. Well, that's not exactly true.

131
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,120
And this is the third part, die. All these guys have to do is just pay off the interest

132
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
on the loans until they die. If you're dead, you can't be taxed now, can you?

133
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,560
Furthermore, when an individual dies, the value that their assets gain during their lifetime

134
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,120
is exempt from tax. Their children can then use these gains to pay off the loans.

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,360
Technically, they're supposed to be a tax on inheritance, but that's no issue for top tax

136
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,759
agents. Trust accounts and other arrangements essentially eliminate any tax that has to be

137
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,559
This technique is cunning, smart, and hidden away from the average person.

138
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,759
Monopolies account for nearly 18% of billionaire wealth. When a single company dominates an

139
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,639
industry, it crushes competition, sets prices, and dictates wages. Back in the original Gilded

140
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,120
Age of the late 1800s, industrial giants controlled steel, oil, and banking. Today,

141
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,440
tech giants control global commerce, information, and infrastructure. Amazon controls over 80% of

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,480
online purchases in major European markets. Google owns 90% of the search engine market.

143
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
Metta, formerly Facebook, owns four of the top five most used social media platforms.

144
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,480
It's present in other industries, too. In Nigeria,

145
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,919
Aliko Dangote has a near monopoly on cement. This gives him massive economic and political

146
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,599
power across Africa. Gata Madani's conglomerate, the Adani Group, has faced accusations of crony

147
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:55,039
capitalism and monopolistic behavior, particularly in sectors like ports and energy. But monopolies

148
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,000
aren't just about wealth. They're about control. They can even influence government policies.

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,599
Even though the United States has checks and balances in place to avoid these exact

150
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:08,319
scenarios, it seems like the loopholes are just as accessible. With all of these factors

151
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:12,959
combined, we're looking at billionaire wealth increasing at an unprecedented rate.

152
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,840
It's actually not just increasing, it's accelerating. Last year, Oxfam predicted that

153
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,759
we would see the worst first trillionaire within a decade. Now we're on track to have

154
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,720
that in five years or sooner. But some people, believe it or not, think that this is actually

155
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
a good thing. They believe that if there's more billionaires, that means that economies are

156
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,320
indeed doing well, and it means that there are opportunities to make massive money.

157
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
And while it's true that wealthy economies tend to create super rich individuals,

158
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
if you look at the GDP per capita and compare it to the number of billionaires,

159
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,120
there's no real correlation. For example, India, Mexico and Brazil have far more billionaires than

160
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
Sweden or Switzerland, despite the fact that these two European countries have a higher GDP

161
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,879
per capita. So what does that mean? It means that in most countries, a handful of ultra-rich

162
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,120
individuals control a massive share of the nation's wealth, while the majority of people

163
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,160
struggle to get by. Now we have to talk about the financial situations that have allowed

164
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,679
billionaires to grow so rapidly very recently. Pumping more money into an economy doesn't

165
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,639
automatically create more wealth for the broader society. Leaving aside the inflation risk,

166
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,679
there's something else at play. The Cantillon effect. The term comes from Richard Cantillon,

167
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,240
an 18th century economist. He noticed that when new money enters an economy,

168
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,120
it doesn't spread out evenly through society. Instead, it benefits those who get access to

169
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,480
the money first. The wealthy and big corporations have first access to new money. They get it

170
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,919
through government contracts, central bank policies and financial institutions. They then

171
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,440
use it to buy stocks, real estate and businesses before inflation kicks in. But for regular

172
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
people who get their money later, they see higher prices before their wages or savings

173
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
have a chance to catch up. Think of it like pouring water from a glass onto the top of a

174
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,159
very large sponge. The water soaks the top first, but by the time it reaches the bottom,

175
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,399
it's soaked through and there's only just a few drops left. And of course, this leads us back

176
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,240
to what we talked about earlier. When governments pumped millions upon millions of dollars

177
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
through the economy, through the mechanism of stimulus checks, unemployment benefits

178
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,360
and business relief programs, it put cash into people's pockets, which at first seemed great.

179
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,480
But then what happened next? Prices skyrocketed, especially, once again,

180
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,840
the prices of assets. Housing and stocks went on an absolute tear. And guess who's most likely

181
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,920
to own these assets? The wealthy. They already had their real estate and their stocks,

182
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,399
so they were happy to see the values soar. Meanwhile, everyday people saw their buying

183
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,800
power shrink due to inflation. Once the stimulus money ran out, people were back

184
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,680
to where they started. Except now, everything was more expensive. And this is why the rich

185
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,080
get richer during times of economic expansion. And it's the same reason why the working

186
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,680
class struggles to keep up with rising costs. So it really is more money, more problems.

187
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
And there's some other side effects when new money enters into an economy.

188
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,120
Whenever a country's government pumps in more money, it supercharges the stock market.

189
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,080
Well, this is not universal, but it's mostly true in the context of modern capitalist

190
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,400
economies. And the claim is backed up by this chart, which is adapted from the financial

191
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,800
analyst Lynn Alden's research in her book, Broken Money. It shows the super tight

192
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,400
correlation between the S&P 500 and government liquidity injections. In simple words,

193
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,160
this chart demonstrates that the more money that the Fed and the US Treasury pump into

194
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,920
an economy, the higher the stock prices soar. These are all publicly traded stocks,

195
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,920
so it must be good for all investors at least. But the problem lies elsewhere.

196
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,600
In 2022, the wealthiest 10% possessed, get this, 93% of all stock market equity.

197
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,920
That means that when the government floods the economy with money, it primarily benefits those

198
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,240
who already have their wealth invested in assets like stocks. For the ultra rich,

199
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,200
it's all their Christmases at once. Meanwhile, for everyone else, enjoy higher rent and

200
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,319
struggling to buy eggs. If you think that sounds unfair, you're not alone. Gary Stevenson,

201
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,960
a former financial trader, economist and YouTuber who graduated from the London School

202
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,720
of Economics explains perfectly.

203
00:17:43,680 --> 00:18:12,880
Stevenson's words drive home a truth. Simply handing out money isn't going to bridge

204
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,240
the wealth gap. It's a much deeper structural problem. And as time progresses, people are

205
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,120
becoming more and more frustrated about it. People are pushing back. Their bitterness is

206
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,680
spilling over online and in the streets. All of this isn't just noise. People are

207
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,040
actually demanding real change.

208
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,600
Why? Because that is the world that we live in that, you know, she is now working three jobs

209
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,960
just to survive. I had another gentleman who had mentioned that he's now living paycheck

210
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,320
to paycheck at a job that he's been at for 30 years and he's a single father. And he's never

211
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,480
felt the pinch like he's doing now. They are now using their credit cards just to pay

212
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,480
some of their bills to survive. So what can be done? Now, in theory, a wealthier society should

213
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
mean better lives for everyone, better schools, better healthcare and better infrastructure.

214
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,079
But if we do compare today to any time in history up until parts of the 20th century,

215
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,880
life is indeed still better. Children don't die of curable illnesses. Most of us have

216
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,000
a smartphone, electricity and clean water. But the time we're in now feels especially

217
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,039
painful because living standards are moving backwards. And now it's at an accelerated rate.

218
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,240
Governments can start with progressively taxing the ultra rich. The idea is that a chunk of

219
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,960
their income can go into funding things like schools and healthcare. A problem with taxing

220
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,079
the rich, though, is that they could just leave the country if the laws become too

221
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,519
strict. So it is still a balance. Speaking of having a balance, here's Milton Friedman

222
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,960
on why 100% inheritance tax is a bad idea, for example. And given that the kind of

223
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,519
people who become successful capitalists do not become that way by giving away their

224
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,400
wealth voluntarily, isn't it necessary to forcibly redistribute wealth before you

225
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,840
can begin to operate under a capitalist system? No, it is not. What is the effect of 100%

226
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,160
inheritance tax? The 100% inheritance tax is to encourage people to dissipate their

227
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,240
wealth in high living. What's the harm in that? The harm in that is that where do you

228
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,480
get the factories? Where do you get the machines? Where do you get the capital

229
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,680
investment? Where do you get the incentive to improve technology? We do forget that the rich,

230
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,680
definitely not all of them, but at least some of them, invest in companies. And this does

231
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,480
help the economy. I guess the difference between now and when this was filmed is that

232
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,720
companies today tend to be focused more on extracting money at all costs, more often than

233
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
not, rather than creating better products for the consumers. But that's a story for another

234
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,240
day. And then there's the financial sector, which is where I think most of the work can be

235
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,960
done. Authorities should look at tightening loopholes. Allowing companies to buy back their

236
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,759
own stock was an absolute disaster, both for the quality of our companies and for wealth

237
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,319
inequality. Companies being able to buy their own stock and push up the price sounds like

238
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:26,000
fraud, but it's legal. Economist Lenore Palladino puts it this way. Stock buyback

239
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,240
programs are, quote, one of the drivers of our imbalanced economy, in which corporate

240
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,960
profits and shareholder payments continue to grow while wages for typical workers stay flat.

241
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,519
And then of course, we have offshore tax havens, creative accounting practices,

242
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,400
or questionable capital gains exemptions. Closing these loopholes could help the wealthiest

243
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,440
contribute their fair share, at least more than 3.4% in tax. Of course, there's the

244
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
argument that it's their hard earned money. Why should they give it back? But this isn't

245
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,880
about punishing success. It's about making sure the system doesn't keep reinforcing

246
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,040
advantages for those already at the top. Closing tax loopholes shouldn't be that

247
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,840
controversial. And yes, governments do squander tax revenues like a fat kid in a candy store,

248
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,160
but at least there's a potential for a fairer tax system to help those who need it most

249
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,720
without inflation. These solutions would be about building a society where success doesn't

250
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,320
come at the expense of everyone else. It's about creating opportunities for everyone,

251
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,600
not just protecting the privileges of a few. There's also proposals of raising the minimum

252
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,120
wage. If multiple countries in the west do have a working poor class, that is, they have full time

253
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,160
jobs but still live in their cars, something is clearly wrong. But then again on the flip

254
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,720
side, many argue that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses or increased costs

255
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,840
for small businesses, and ultimately even end up being inflationary. These solutions are hard,

256
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,160
they're nuanced, and they'll take time, competent leadership, and a lot of thought to

257
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,480
get right. But there's no getting around it. If we want to avoid mass riots and social

258
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,200
disruption in 10 years, ultimately something has to be done if we're to lessen the gap.

259
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,079
Here's Gary again.

260
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:41,200
These are not one size fits all solutions. The economic situation and overall state of

261
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,759
your country can be extremely different depending on where you are. Not every place has the same

262
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,120
problem. What works in the US might flop in India or vice versa. The fact of the matter is,

263
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,600
billionaire wealth buys political influences to tip the scales in their favour. And it's an

264
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,240
uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere. And even if we are just discussing solutions in

265
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,200
broader strokes, it's a start. So what do you guys think about all of this? It is a strange

266
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,880
time to live in, but I'd like to hear what some of your solutions could be. Maybe we can

267
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,280
get a conversation going in the comments section below. To kick off the discussion,

268
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,440
over on the ColdFusion Instagram, there was a post in reference to this video. Under it,

269
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
there were some interesting comments in response. One user expresses a common viewpoint.

270
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,120
If a billionaire creates jobs for countless people, then what's wrong with that?

271
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,039
The main problem is hoarding wealth and not really contributing to society.

272
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,799
I guess that ties into what we've learned from this episode. A lot of the ultra wealthy

273
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,720
don't make most of their money from industry, but investments, especially the stock market,

274
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,880
and taking out loans against those investments is collateral. But do you agree with that?

275
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,039
Billionaires are fine as long as they create jobs and contribute to society.

276
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,319
Feel free to discuss. The Trump tariffs gave the world whiplash. Stock markets plunged,

277
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,039
vaulted higher, and then plunged again. But in the chaos, some people made money.

278
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,359
And this has caused accusations of insider trading. But if you wanted to know more

279
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,759
about this news story, it's such a politically charged topic that it makes things hard.

280
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,200
How would you get the viewpoints of both sides? Well, today's sponsor,

281
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,920
Ground News, is doing just that. Ground News is a website and app developed by a former

282
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,640
NASA engineer. She was on a mission to give readers an easy, data-driven, objective way to

283
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,359
read the news. Using the Trump tariff story as an example, sources on the left highlighted

284
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,759
Trump's potential profit from insider information, conflicts of interest, and not to mention

285
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,119
potential economic damage. Sources on the right, however, slammed the Democrat investigations

286
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,920
as partisan games. And they portrayed the tariff pause to be a strategic move against the enemy,

287
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,400
namely China. And it was also seen as a calculated success. Scrolling down,

288
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,840
I can compare every single article on the topic with convenient tags.

289
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,400
Tags that show me context about the source, like how factual it is, and who owns it.

290
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,240
Ground News' blind spot feed is also great. This shows you stories that have been

291
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,720
underreported by one side of the political spectrum. For example, if you're on the left,

292
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,440
you might have missed the story about gold reaching record highs. So, Ground News is a

293
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,279
fantastic tool for getting international views, shifting through misinformation,

294
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,000
and identifying bias. They provide you all the tools you need to be a critical thinker.

295
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,759
Today, Ground News is offering 40% off their Vantage subscription.
