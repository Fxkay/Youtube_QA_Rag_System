00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.600
Hi, welcome to another episode of ColdFusion. Take a look at this picture. It features prominent

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.919
tech individuals like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai,

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.800
and Tesla's Elon Musk. As of recording this video, the combined net worth of these four

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.480
people is over $700 billion. In fact, Mark, Jeff, and Elon are centi-billionaires.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.359
Of course, the recent stock market dip may have wiped off some of their wealth,

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.640
but these billionaires can still sleep easy enough at night. People with dozen-digit fortunes

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.240
didn't exist eight years ago, but now according to the Forbes 2025 billionaire list, a record

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.719
15 people are on that list, and that's up from just six in 2023. When Forbes first made this

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.519
list in 1987, they had to scrape to find individuals worth more than $28 billion,

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.200
adjusted for inflation, and all they could find were just two Japanese tycoons. And now

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.240
today, that $28 billion amount isn't even enough to land you in the top 50 of that list.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.159
The trend is as clear as day. There's no stopping these billionaires. In 2024 alone,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.000
billionaire wealth surged by $2 trillion. That's at a rate three times faster than

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.520
the entire global economy. And for the first time in history, the richest Americans now pay

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.520
less tax than the working class. Something is clearly wrong. But what? It's not a question

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.840
of why there's such inequality, but more a question of how this is all happening.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.359
Why are families struggling to buy cartons of eggs, while billionaires seem to keep adding

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.679
to their wealth with absolute ease? What happens to the world economy if this trend

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.560
keeps on going? Does the middle class cease to exist? And what can we do to fix all of this

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.359
and not repeat the same mistakes? Let's take a look.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.200
The world's richest people are just getting richer and even faster than expected.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.920
Oxfam's annual inequality report says five people are now on track to reach

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
trillionaire status within the next decade. Elon Musk is first in line,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.160
followed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.320
LVMH's Bernard Arnaud. Whenever numbers like millions, billions and trillions are discussed,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.000
it's often difficult to put the vast difference between them into context.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.200
So let's start there. If you, yes you watching, made $1 every second,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.400
you'd be a millionaire in 12 days. That's under two weeks.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.320
But how long would it take to reach a billion dollars? Six months? A year? Well,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.480
at a rate of $1 per second, every day, non-stop, you'd need over 31 years.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.840
And that's just for 1 billion. As we know, the world's richest have not just 1 billion,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.160
but tens, even hundreds of billions. And their wealth just keeps growing.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.639
For example, in 2024, their combined wealth skyrocketed from 13 trillion to 15 trillion

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.120
in just 12 months. And the richest 10 men saw their fortunes grow by an average of 100 million

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.519
per day. That's more than what entire villages or towns in some parts of the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.680
world will earn in a lifetime, every single day. And these guys, the billionaires,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.199
have been absolute vacuum cleaners of wealth over the past few decades.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.560
The top 1% alone has captured 38% of all new wealth created since 1995.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.640
And this is at the same time where the poorest half of the world's population,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.200
which is around 3.8 billion people, owns just 2% of global wealth.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.200
Think about that for a second. No matter how you look at it, these stats are staggering.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.560
The ultra-rich are clearly pulling further ahead, while half the world is effectively

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.800
locked out of wealth. And it goes further. It's not just numbers on paper.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.479
This kind of money can warp economies, influence politics,

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.520
and shape the world in ways that we can barely comprehend.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.759
You don't see it much on TV. You don't hear it talked about here at all.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:17.439
But the American people do not believe that it is appropriate that three people, one, two,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:25.439
three, Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos, and Mr. Zuckerberg, three Americans own more wealth than the bottom

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:33.279
half of American society, 170 million people. And that's not a useless fact either. Massive

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:37.839
wealth inequality usually comes before internal conflict. Or more accurately,

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:44.879
it's a symptom of a deeper problem. When the government has problems funding itself,

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.800
when there are bad economic conditions and living standards for most people are declining,

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:59.439
and there are large wealth values and political gaps, internal conflict between the rich and

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:05.680
the poor as well as different ethnic, religious, and racial groups greatly increases.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.759
This leads to political extremism that shows up as populism of the left or the right.

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.959
Those of the left seek to redistribute the wealth, while those of the right seek to

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:22.719
maintain the wealth in the hands of the rich. Ray Dalio, a billionaire investor and economic

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:28.159
historian puts it this way. Quote, I've studied the last 500 years of history and cycles,

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.879
and these things repeat over and over again. Large wealth gaps with large value gaps at

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.959
the same time, as there's a lot of debt and there's an economic downturn produces

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:42.079
conflict and vulnerability. One of the biggest impacts the rising wealth gap has had is the

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:46.159
shrinking middle class. The middle class is one of the hallmarks of a healthy economy,

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.000
so when they shrink and start to falter, it's a symptom of a wider problem.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.039
It's been a slow process, but we all know deep down that something is going wrong.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.079
If you think back to the TV shows of the 80s and the 90s, it wasn't uncommon to find

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:04.879
characters that live comfortably on just a single wage. Life was portrayed as financially

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:09.680
easy, and that's because relatively, it really was. But then things started to go wrong.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:15.199
When you really think about how the economy has been, since I left high school in the late 2000s,

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.680
the middle class just couldn't catch a break. In 2008, there was the housing crisis,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.680
which turned into an international global financial crisis. Europe got a second wind

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.800
of that disaster around 2011. In most of the western world, the average Joe was hit by an

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.920
economic bomb. Small businesses closed, jobs were lost, and households were struggling.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.960
Over the next decade, growth was permanently slower than before because the real economy had died,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.879
and I've covered that in detail in a previous video. But other than that,

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.960
people were still getting by, but then came COVID. The government response shuttered entire

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.600
economies, leaving everyday people straining themselves just to get by. And there's a

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.480
famous saying, question, what words do you never want to hear? Answer, I'm from the

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.600
government and I'm here to help. And this joke played out in real time when governments

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.360
turned on the money printers to counteract their shutdown policies. They thought they

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.879
were helping, but the result was yet another disaster. Now, today, we're left with rising

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:18.400
inflation, stagnant wages, and soaring living costs. And the pressure is only getting worse.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.000
The middle, 40% of the global population, owns just 22% of global wealth. But at the

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.199
top end of town, it's exactly the opposite. Making money seems easier than ever before.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.759
As it turns out, all that government printing helped the stock market,

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.160
which helped the billionaires. But we'll get to that in a bit.

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:42.879
As the saying goes, wealth begets more wealth. So this acceleration will continue. But before

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:47.600
we get into the weeds, we need to back up a little bit. How are these guys getting so rich?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.680
How does one even become a billionaire?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.080
Is it ethical to be a billionaire? Well, that depends on your political leanings.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.439
But some individuals do indeed have a rag to riches story. But the pleasantries start and

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:10.320
end there. A growing number of billionaires tend to come through one of three routes,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.439
monopolies, inheritance, and corruption. According to Forbes, the most common way

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:20.399
to become a billionaire is through finance. In fact, nearly one in six billionaires,

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:25.759
or just over 15%, made their money in finance and investments. The second most common way is

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:31.680
technology at 12%. And the third, manufacturing, also at 12%. But it's not just by hard work

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.679
and innovation. Billionaires don't play by the same rules as the rest of us.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.200
And in this section, we'll cover the three ways that this is the case.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.720
Number one, inheritance. In 2023, more new billionaires inherited their wealth than built

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.560
it. Every single billionaire under 30 was born rich. The problem is, in a lot of cases,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.080
depending on where you are, there's no tax on this kind of wealth transfer.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:58.320
While the average person works decades to build financial security,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.879
billionaire families pass down fortunes, tax-free, and they keep their wealth locked

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:08.640
up in an exclusive family club. Number two, corruption and loopholes. Many argue that the

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:13.840
financial system is designed to protect the wealthy. Just look at the 2008 financial crisis.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.799
Banks made reckless bets, crashed the economy, and then got bailed out with billions in taxpayer

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:23.679
dollars. It's capitalized the profits and socialized the losses. Meanwhile, millions of

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:29.759
people lost their homes, jobs, and savings. And it's not just banks. The very top percent

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:34.480
of earners avoid taxes like a plague. They stash money in offshore accounts or borrow

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.960
against their assets instead of selling them. And this means that they don't have taxable income.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.759
If I told you that in the U.S., for example, the richest 25 people in the country paid an

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:49.920
effective tax rate of 3.4%, you'd cry foul. Why should the average person be taxed at

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.519
six times more when they earn a tiny, infinitesimal fraction of what the billionaires earn?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.960
Well, although unfair, it's perfectly legal and it's a bit of a rabbit hole.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.360
But hear me out. This is called the buy-borrow-die technique.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.519
Edward McCaffrey, the scholar who coined the term buy-borrow-die, says that this technique

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:16.879
is being abused so much that it, quote, has basically killed the entire concept of an

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:21.680
income tax for the wealthiest individuals, end quote. But he goes on to add that it's, quote,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.360
the most important tax avoidance strategy today, end quote. So here's how it goes.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.279
Instead of working a nine-to-five wage and then getting taxed like a pleb,

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:35.519
the best way to earn wealth is through accumulating appreciating paper assets like

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:40.399
stocks. The wealth isn't taxed until these stocks are sold. Yes, a tariff surprise or

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:44.879
another stock market shock may make the wealthy sweat a little bit. But overall,

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:48.800
in the big picture over the past few decades, you'd be doing well.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.800
And the next step, borrow. Since there are no taxes for loans, the genius part of this

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.960
is that the wealthy simply just borrow against their existing assets to buy more things.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.200
Take Larry Ellison of Oracle, for example. He built a 270 million dollar yacht, an 80 million

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.840
dollar mansion, and even bought an island worth 30 million, all from borrowing against

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.400
30 billion of Oracle's stock as collateral. But I know what you're thinking. You can't

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.640
just keep doing this. These loans have to be paid off at some time. And when they do,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.080
these guys are going to have to sell their assets. Well, that's not exactly true.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:27.120
And this is the third part, die. All these guys have to do is just pay off the interest

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.040
on the loans until they die. If you're dead, you can't be taxed now, can you?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.560
Furthermore, when an individual dies, the value that their assets gain during their lifetime

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.120
is exempt from tax. Their children can then use these gains to pay off the loans.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.360
Technically, they're supposed to be a tax on inheritance, but that's no issue for top tax

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.759
agents. Trust accounts and other arrangements essentially eliminate any tax that has to be

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:54.559
This technique is cunning, smart, and hidden away from the average person.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.759
Monopolies account for nearly 18% of billionaire wealth. When a single company dominates an

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:10.639
industry, it crushes competition, sets prices, and dictates wages. Back in the original Gilded

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:17.120
Age of the late 1800s, industrial giants controlled steel, oil, and banking. Today,

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.440
tech giants control global commerce, information, and infrastructure. Amazon controls over 80% of

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.480
online purchases in major European markets. Google owns 90% of the search engine market.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.600
Metta, formerly Facebook, owns four of the top five most used social media platforms.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.480
It's present in other industries, too. In Nigeria,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.919
Aliko Dangote has a near monopoly on cement. This gives him massive economic and political

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:49.599
power across Africa. Gata Madani's conglomerate, the Adani Group, has faced accusations of crony

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:55.039
capitalism and monopolistic behavior, particularly in sectors like ports and energy. But monopolies

00:12:55.039 --> 00:13:00.000
aren't just about wealth. They're about control. They can even influence government policies.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.599
Even though the United States has checks and balances in place to avoid these exact

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:08.319
scenarios, it seems like the loopholes are just as accessible. With all of these factors

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:12.959
combined, we're looking at billionaire wealth increasing at an unprecedented rate.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.840
It's actually not just increasing, it's accelerating. Last year, Oxfam predicted that

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.759
we would see the worst first trillionaire within a decade. Now we're on track to have

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:26.720
that in five years or sooner. But some people, believe it or not, think that this is actually

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.560
a good thing. They believe that if there's more billionaires, that means that economies are

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.320
indeed doing well, and it means that there are opportunities to make massive money.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.639
And while it's true that wealthy economies tend to create super rich individuals,

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:42.320
if you look at the GDP per capita and compare it to the number of billionaires,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:49.120
there's no real correlation. For example, India, Mexico and Brazil have far more billionaires than

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.680
Sweden or Switzerland, despite the fact that these two European countries have a higher GDP

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.879
per capita. So what does that mean? It means that in most countries, a handful of ultra-rich

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:03.120
individuals control a massive share of the nation's wealth, while the majority of people

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.160
struggle to get by. Now we have to talk about the financial situations that have allowed

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:15.679
billionaires to grow so rapidly very recently. Pumping more money into an economy doesn't

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:20.639
automatically create more wealth for the broader society. Leaving aside the inflation risk,

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:25.679
there's something else at play. The Cantillon effect. The term comes from Richard Cantillon,

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:30.240
an 18th century economist. He noticed that when new money enters an economy,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.120
it doesn't spread out evenly through society. Instead, it benefits those who get access to

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.480
the money first. The wealthy and big corporations have first access to new money. They get it

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.919
through government contracts, central bank policies and financial institutions. They then

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:51.440
use it to buy stocks, real estate and businesses before inflation kicks in. But for regular

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.240
people who get their money later, they see higher prices before their wages or savings

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.360
have a chance to catch up. Think of it like pouring water from a glass onto the top of a

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.159
very large sponge. The water soaks the top first, but by the time it reaches the bottom,

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:10.399
it's soaked through and there's only just a few drops left. And of course, this leads us back

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:14.240
to what we talked about earlier. When governments pumped millions upon millions of dollars

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.240
through the economy, through the mechanism of stimulus checks, unemployment benefits

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.360
and business relief programs, it put cash into people's pockets, which at first seemed great.

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:28.480
But then what happened next? Prices skyrocketed, especially, once again,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.840
the prices of assets. Housing and stocks went on an absolute tear. And guess who's most likely

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.920
to own these assets? The wealthy. They already had their real estate and their stocks,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.399
so they were happy to see the values soar. Meanwhile, everyday people saw their buying

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:46.800
power shrink due to inflation. Once the stimulus money ran out, people were back

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.680
to where they started. Except now, everything was more expensive. And this is why the rich

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.080
get richer during times of economic expansion. And it's the same reason why the working

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.680
class struggles to keep up with rising costs. So it really is more money, more problems.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.040
And there's some other side effects when new money enters into an economy.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.120
Whenever a country's government pumps in more money, it supercharges the stock market.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.080
Well, this is not universal, but it's mostly true in the context of modern capitalist

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.400
economies. And the claim is backed up by this chart, which is adapted from the financial

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.800
analyst Lynn Alden's research in her book, Broken Money. It shows the super tight

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.400
correlation between the S&P 500 and government liquidity injections. In simple words,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.160
this chart demonstrates that the more money that the Fed and the US Treasury pump into

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.920
an economy, the higher the stock prices soar. These are all publicly traded stocks,

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.920
so it must be good for all investors at least. But the problem lies elsewhere.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.600
In 2022, the wealthiest 10% possessed, get this, 93% of all stock market equity.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.920
That means that when the government floods the economy with money, it primarily benefits those

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.240
who already have their wealth invested in assets like stocks. For the ultra rich,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.200
it's all their Christmases at once. Meanwhile, for everyone else, enjoy higher rent and

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.319
struggling to buy eggs. If you think that sounds unfair, you're not alone. Gary Stevenson,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.960
a former financial trader, economist and YouTuber who graduated from the London School

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.720
of Economics explains perfectly.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:18:12.880
Stevenson's words drive home a truth. Simply handing out money isn't going to bridge

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.240
the wealth gap. It's a much deeper structural problem. And as time progresses, people are

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.120
becoming more and more frustrated about it. People are pushing back. Their bitterness is

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.680
spilling over online and in the streets. All of this isn't just noise. People are

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.040
actually demanding real change.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.600
Why? Because that is the world that we live in that, you know, she is now working three jobs

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.960
just to survive. I had another gentleman who had mentioned that he's now living paycheck

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:04.320
to paycheck at a job that he's been at for 30 years and he's a single father. And he's never

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.480
felt the pinch like he's doing now. They are now using their credit cards just to pay

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:18.480
some of their bills to survive. So what can be done? Now, in theory, a wealthier society should

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.120
mean better lives for everyone, better schools, better healthcare and better infrastructure.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.079
But if we do compare today to any time in history up until parts of the 20th century,

00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:32.880
life is indeed still better. Children don't die of curable illnesses. Most of us have

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.000
a smartphone, electricity and clean water. But the time we're in now feels especially

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.039
painful because living standards are moving backwards. And now it's at an accelerated rate.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.240
Governments can start with progressively taxing the ultra rich. The idea is that a chunk of

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.960
their income can go into funding things like schools and healthcare. A problem with taxing

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.079
the rich, though, is that they could just leave the country if the laws become too

00:19:56.079 --> 00:20:01.519
strict. So it is still a balance. Speaking of having a balance, here's Milton Friedman

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:06.960
on why 100% inheritance tax is a bad idea, for example. And given that the kind of

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.519
people who become successful capitalists do not become that way by giving away their

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:16.400
wealth voluntarily, isn't it necessary to forcibly redistribute wealth before you

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.840
can begin to operate under a capitalist system? No, it is not. What is the effect of 100%

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.160
inheritance tax? The 100% inheritance tax is to encourage people to dissipate their

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:34.240
wealth in high living. What's the harm in that? The harm in that is that where do you

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.480
get the factories? Where do you get the machines? Where do you get the capital

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.680
investment? Where do you get the incentive to improve technology? We do forget that the rich,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.680
definitely not all of them, but at least some of them, invest in companies. And this does

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.480
help the economy. I guess the difference between now and when this was filmed is that

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.720
companies today tend to be focused more on extracting money at all costs, more often than

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.960
not, rather than creating better products for the consumers. But that's a story for another

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.240
day. And then there's the financial sector, which is where I think most of the work can be

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.960
done. Authorities should look at tightening loopholes. Allowing companies to buy back their

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.759
own stock was an absolute disaster, both for the quality of our companies and for wealth

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:20.319
inequality. Companies being able to buy their own stock and push up the price sounds like

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:26.000
fraud, but it's legal. Economist Lenore Palladino puts it this way. Stock buyback

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.240
programs are, quote, one of the drivers of our imbalanced economy, in which corporate

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.960
profits and shareholder payments continue to grow while wages for typical workers stay flat.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.519
And then of course, we have offshore tax havens, creative accounting practices,

00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:44.400
or questionable capital gains exemptions. Closing these loopholes could help the wealthiest

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.440
contribute their fair share, at least more than 3.4% in tax. Of course, there's the

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.960
argument that it's their hard earned money. Why should they give it back? But this isn't

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.880
about punishing success. It's about making sure the system doesn't keep reinforcing

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.040
advantages for those already at the top. Closing tax loopholes shouldn't be that

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.840
controversial. And yes, governments do squander tax revenues like a fat kid in a candy store,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.160
but at least there's a potential for a fairer tax system to help those who need it most

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.720
without inflation. These solutions would be about building a society where success doesn't

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.320
come at the expense of everyone else. It's about creating opportunities for everyone,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.600
not just protecting the privileges of a few. There's also proposals of raising the minimum

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.120
wage. If multiple countries in the west do have a working poor class, that is, they have full time

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.160
jobs but still live in their cars, something is clearly wrong. But then again on the flip

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.720
side, many argue that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses or increased costs

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.840
for small businesses, and ultimately even end up being inflationary. These solutions are hard,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.160
they're nuanced, and they'll take time, competent leadership, and a lot of thought to

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.480
get right. But there's no getting around it. If we want to avoid mass riots and social

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.200
disruption in 10 years, ultimately something has to be done if we're to lessen the gap.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.079
Here's Gary again.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:41.200
These are not one size fits all solutions. The economic situation and overall state of

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.759
your country can be extremely different depending on where you are. Not every place has the same

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:51.120
problem. What works in the US might flop in India or vice versa. The fact of the matter is,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.600
billionaire wealth buys political influences to tip the scales in their favour. And it's an

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.240
uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere. And even if we are just discussing solutions in

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.200
broader strokes, it's a start. So what do you guys think about all of this? It is a strange

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.880
time to live in, but I'd like to hear what some of your solutions could be. Maybe we can

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.280
get a conversation going in the comments section below. To kick off the discussion,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.440
over on the ColdFusion Instagram, there was a post in reference to this video. Under it,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.440
there were some interesting comments in response. One user expresses a common viewpoint.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.120
If a billionaire creates jobs for countless people, then what's wrong with that?

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.039
The main problem is hoarding wealth and not really contributing to society.

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:32.799
I guess that ties into what we've learned from this episode. A lot of the ultra wealthy

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:36.720
don't make most of their money from industry, but investments, especially the stock market,

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.880
and taking out loans against those investments is collateral. But do you agree with that?

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.039
Billionaires are fine as long as they create jobs and contribute to society.

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:50.319
Feel free to discuss. The Trump tariffs gave the world whiplash. Stock markets plunged,

00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:55.039
vaulted higher, and then plunged again. But in the chaos, some people made money.

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:09.359
And this has caused accusations of insider trading. But if you wanted to know more

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:13.759
about this news story, it's such a politically charged topic that it makes things hard.

00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:17.200
How would you get the viewpoints of both sides? Well, today's sponsor,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.920
Ground News, is doing just that. Ground News is a website and app developed by a former

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.640
NASA engineer. She was on a mission to give readers an easy, data-driven, objective way to

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.359
read the news. Using the Trump tariff story as an example, sources on the left highlighted

00:25:31.359 --> 00:25:35.759
Trump's potential profit from insider information, conflicts of interest, and not to mention

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:41.119
potential economic damage. Sources on the right, however, slammed the Democrat investigations

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.920
as partisan games. And they portrayed the tariff pause to be a strategic move against the enemy,

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.400
namely China. And it was also seen as a calculated success. Scrolling down,

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.840
I can compare every single article on the topic with convenient tags.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.400
Tags that show me context about the source, like how factual it is, and who owns it.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.240
Ground News' blind spot feed is also great. This shows you stories that have been

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.720
underreported by one side of the political spectrum. For example, if you're on the left,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.440
you might have missed the story about gold reaching record highs. So, Ground News is a

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.279
fantastic tool for getting international views, shifting through misinformation,

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:20.000
and identifying bias. They provide you all the tools you need to be a critical thinker.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.759
Today, Ground News is offering 40% off their Vantage subscription.

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:27.839
This comes with a feature called My News Bias, so you can even track your news

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:33.519
viewing habits over time. To get started, go to ground.news slash coldfusion.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.000
But anyway, that's about it from me. Thanks for watching this longer episode.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.160
I really appreciate you staying till the end. My name is Tagogo, and you've been watching

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.160
ColdFusion, and I'll catch you again soon for the next episode. Cheers guys. Have a good one.

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:18.160
ColdFusion. It's new thinking.
